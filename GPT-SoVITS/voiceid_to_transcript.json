    "maleuniquedelvinmallory": "The Guild's at full strength, and we have you to thank for it. We've had our share of dark times, and now they seem like a distant memory.",
    "malenoromir": "I have already sold the flute. There's no point in keeping it. Since I'm not a bard, and I have no idea how to play it.",
    "femaleelfhaughty": "In the end, I relied on a woman's natural weapons, beauty and seduction. The rest was a formality, though a rather wet, messy formality.",
    "femaleuniqueelenwen": "Of course not. One does not gather the most important men and women of Skyrim and then serve them cheap ale and stale bread.",
    "azzarianvoice": "Strange. I seem to have lost the Chief's journal. Lucky for you, I made another one, just in case. It was too valuable not to. Here.",
    "nevynvoice": "Then get on a boat to Morrowind. We don't have anything, save the usual Nord bile, but you don't see any of the others complaining.",
    "fanarvoice": "strange that you make that a choice i myself know what it is like to work alone but only because many khajiit do not value my skills",
    "beatricevoice": "it is not just the past but the future that hangs in the balance we honour not only history but we inspire the poets and bards of the age to come",
    "femaleoldkindly": "Oh, very well. But my energies are low. I warn you, I won't be able to see much. Give me five gold and I'll do what I can.",
    "femaleorc": "By tradition, a mother always teaches her children how to smith. If a chief has a second wife, she is called the forge wife in honor of this.",
    "kaivoice": "I have something for you. It's a Nord Warhorn, carved from a bit of tusk. You can use it if we ever get separated. I'll hear it, and I'll be able to find you.",
    "aawhiterunhalldis": "Since Adrianne and Ulfberth are both gone, I've taken over the shop. Let me know if you want to buy something.",
    "durazvoice": "the bandit tried to hire me once thought i'd treat him like a chief and polish his weapon whatever that means in the end his blood polished mine",
    "kiannavoice": "i explained to the brute using very small words that i was an alchemist of some skill and could mix powerful potions on his behalf",
    "gorrvoice": "Business, friend, business. Perhaps when our adventuring days are over, we can open the finest horker stew shop in Skyrim. That, or a brothel.",
    "maleuniquecicero": "Looks like Cicero's not the only one to go a little crazy from time to time, eh? Listener! You should talk to Nazir. Work this whole mess out.",
    "maleuniquegallus": "With the Ebon Mirror closed, and their sudden severance from the realm of Everglow, I fear they've undergone a drastic change.",
    "arelthorvoice": "There's rumors of a double agent working in the embassy. Some say they are lies meant to cause dissension, but I'm not so sure.",
    "valenorvoice": "I also pass on the word if anybody wants to do business. He has a place in Yalmarch, near that old Crabbers shanty, where he makes his deals.",
    "maleuniquemercerfrey": "Don't dismiss our adversaries so easily. They're well-funded, patient, and have been able to avoid identification for years.",
    "malecondescending": "You mean the wedding? My cousin's apparent murder? An unfortunate misunderstanding. No more. Cold mead. Hot tempers. These things happen.",
    "urzubvoice": "It isn't as easy as rubbing two sticks together. Believe me, I've tried. And in the end, all I had to show for it were two worn out sticks.",
    "iriavoice": "That's why efficiency is crucial in the field. Many deaths happen because there's simply not enough time to find a healer.",
    "langley": "observation giants are sometimes prone to great fits of weeping when they think they are alone theories self-doubt guilt and ugliness very true",
    "inigofollowervoice": "Dear diary, I just realized that you may be responding, but I cannot see what you are writing. Damn invisible ink. I am sorry if I was rude about you earlier.",
    "malenordcommander": "Skyrim is the birthplace of humanity, the birthplace of honor, and those snowbacked Imperials renounced both when they laid down before the Thalmor.",
    "dlc1femaleuniquefura": "I feed when I'm hungry, I sleep when I'm tired, and I kill whenever I'm in the mood. Those are the things that are important to me.",
    "mjb_eilram": "well i do a bit of everything really look around you it's mostly farms so there's always a need to keep the tools sharp horses shot and the guards need their weapons and armour maintained",
    "ingartevoice": "in here we get bandits pirates adventurers and soldiers lads and lasses with true grit not the college and town fort you get up west"
